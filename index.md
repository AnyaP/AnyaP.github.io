I am a PhD student in Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning.
I have been working on topic modeling for several years, mostly from [additive regularization perspective](http://bigartm.org/). Currently, I am working on distributional semantics, and bridging the gap between topic models and other methods to learn word embeddings.


I'm enrolled to a full-time PhD program, jointly organized by Yandex and Higher School of Economics, Moscow, Russia. Prior to that, I graduated from Computer Science Department, Moscow State University in 2014 and Yandex School of Data Analysis, where we had courses on Probabilistic Graphical Models, Deep Neural Networks, Natural Language Processing, Statistical Machine Translation, and other related disciplines.


In summer 2016 I had an internship at Google Zurich, where I developed models to automatically expand pre-defined categories with new n-grams and concepts based on by distributional similarity. Currently I'm working on applied machine learning projects at Yandex and teaching machine learning at Higher School of Economics.
