Hey there!
This is the first blog post on the brand new Personal Page that was launched
as a birthday gift to Anya Potapenko from Andrey Kashin.

Being not very ordinary, this gift still complies to category "handmade",
so I believe it's good :)
Also, I feel like this is a historical moment, so it should definitely be recorded
to remind about this fun times!
