I have graduated from Moscow State University with a major in Computer Science.
During the last years of studies I got super exited about Machine Learning and went to [Yandex School Of Data Analysis](https://yandexdataschool.com/).
There were great people, great coffee, and last but not least - great courses :) Probabilistic Graphical Models by [Dmitry Vetrov](https://cs.hse.ru/en/bayesgroup/people/vetrov), Statistical Machine Translation by [David Talbot](https://research.google.com/pubs/DavidTalbot.html), Deep Learning for Computer Vision by [Victor Lempitsky](http://sites.skoltech.ru/compvision/members/vilem/) and many more.

Currently, I am a PhD student on Natural Language Understanding under supervision of Prof. [Konstantin Vorontsov](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=KIW4fnsAAAAJ&hl=en&authuser=1).
During my masters I was working on [Additive Regularization of Topic Models](bigartm.org).
Now I am bridging the gap between those techniques and neural networks.
Particularly, I show how to learn probabilistic interpretable sparse embeddings for words, documents and other modalities.

During my PhD I have done several internships:

* Summer 2016 - Google, Ads Quality team.

I developed models to expand categories with new concepts based on distributional similarities.

* Fall-Winter 2016 - [Yandex Data Factory](https://yandexdatafactory.com/).

I was working on time series prediction, news mining, and other applied machine learning projects.

* Summer 2017 - Google, Assistant team.

I did research on soft and hard attention in neural networks for dialogue systems.
